# How to learn modern Machine Learning
**A guide to the adventurer**<br>
First of all basic machine learning can be simple to understand, but to understand it deeply and see were the rabbit hole goes you have to do some serious kind of study. The plan to enlightenment has multiple parallel path’s, but books, internet info, youtube video channels, free online courses, constitute the main pillars.<br>
<br>

## Books
I’m suggesting that you read the books from cover to cover and not only for reference.<br>

### Most important books
The first book that you should read is a cheap book but a very good one. It summarizes in a small amount of pages what is the bulk of machine learning. <br>
<br>
